# partitioning algorithm
# implements consistent hashing 

# procedure
# 1. hash nodes then apply modulo number of nodes in system
# 2. hash "data" then apply modulo number of nodes in system

# each data packet corresponds to a node on a unit circle of integers
# ownership of data is defined as:
#	the predecessor on the circle
#	the data between two nodes on the circle
