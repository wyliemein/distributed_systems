Our system implements consistent hashing of keys with shard replication.  
We do this by mapping virtual shards to physical shards on each node in a  
deterministic manner. We then implemented vector clocks for each node to  
ensure causal consistency. In order to propage eventual consistency we  
implemented a gossip protocol with random wake ups.
