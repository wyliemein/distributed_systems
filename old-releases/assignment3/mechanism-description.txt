We set out to organize the root app.py file. This involved wrapping all prior GET, PUT, DELETE functionality in an external node.py 
class. 

Next, we implemented the construction method of the node class to store all local environment information. 

Then, we decided to stick with `mod` n for hashing to proper locations

Our node implementation allowed for very flexible data pass through that made the network function correctly with flexible requests to prevent rewriting or fixing data.

Our modular implementation of each class kept our codebase concise and understandable which helped each of us contribute to every area.
